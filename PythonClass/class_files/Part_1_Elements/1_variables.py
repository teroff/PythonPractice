Variables

Documentation:
	https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm

In Python, you create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name.
You can use any name you like, as long as it doesn't conflict with a name reserved by Python.

# We use the variable name spam here to make it clear this is a name we chose:
spam = 5


# A variable is a placeholder for a value, and can be used anywhere the value could be used:
spam = spam + 5		# spam is now 10


# A shortcut for adding a number to the variable is += :
spam += 10			# spam is now 20
print spam
