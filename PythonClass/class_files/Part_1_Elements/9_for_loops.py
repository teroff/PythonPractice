For loops

A for loop goes through each item in a list one at a time.
'''
products = ['iPad', 'Watch', 'iMac', 'Music']

# A for loop is constucted as:
# 	for variable in listname:
# The variable can be any name you like. 
# Python iterates through the list; each time through, the variable points to the current item.
for spam in products:
	print spam

'''
This prints the following:

iPad
Watch
iMac
Music
